# Snake.c

> my first big project in c

this little snake game is coded in c, using the ncurses libraire

run `make` or `make build`to compile the game. if any error occur, try running `make fix`, it will install any dependencies to properly compile the executable.

use `make run` or execute "./snake" to start the game



thanks for your attention!

(there is curently no support for Windows, and is untested on macOS)
